# Documentation
The documentation is automatically built through [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org) following the [RST](https://sphinx-tutorial.readthedocs.io/step-1/) syntax.
You should change just the files in the `souce/` folder.


## Build the docs
In order to see the results of your changes in the `source/` folder locally, just run the following command under the `docs/` folder:
```
make html
```
