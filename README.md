ALERT: I'm working on building a Python package in order to ease the use of the software in an academic environment, write me in case you need a temporary working solution (email: a.bonvini96@gmail.com).

This repository contains a `C++` implementation of the `MATLAB` software provided by Riccardo Barbieri and Luca
Citi [here](http://users.neurostat.mit.edu/barbieri/pphrv).

*Refer to the following papers for more details:*

- [*A point-process model of human heartbeat intervals: new definitions of heart rate and heart rate
  variability*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15374824/)
- [*The time-rescaling theorem and its application to neural spike train data
  analysis*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11802915/)

# Requirements

The project can be built with `CMake`, the only dependencies are [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org)
and [Boost](https://www.boost.org).

# Documentation

The technical and scientific *documentation* for this repository is available [here](https://pointprocess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). (WIP)
